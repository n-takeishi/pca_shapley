# Shapley value for reconstruction errors of PCA

This is a set of demo scripts to compute the Shapley values of reconstruction
error of PCA, with its conditional expectations as a characteristic function.

## Usage

shapely_exact.m computes the exact Shapley value based on the original definition.
shapley_mc.m performs simple Monte Carlo approximation.

Run demo.m for a simple demonstration.

The paper also also appeared in the Workshop on Learning and Mining with
Industrial Data, Beijing, November 2019. The corresponding reference is in Proc.
of ICDM Workshops, pp.793â€“798, 2019. (DOI: 10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00117)
However, *I recommend to refer to the arXiv version above because the workshop's
manuscript contains typos in Eqs. (14) and (18)* (sorry...).
